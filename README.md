A tool to trace a sketch over an original painting by dynamically uploading images.

## Workflow

1. Open the page in a browser.
2. Upload **Original Image** first.
3. Upload **Target/Sketch Image** second.
4. Once both images are loaded, they are stacked for tracing.

## Controls

- `1` → Fully transparent overlay (opacity 0)  
- `2` → Fully opaque overlay (opacity 1)  
- `3` → Fast fade  
- `4` → Medium fade  
- `5` → Slow fade  
- `6` → Very slow fade  

## Notes

- Both images **must have exactly the same dimensions**.  
- Zoom using the browser’s zoom (`Ctrl` + `+` / `-`).  
- Scrollbars allow navigation of large images.
